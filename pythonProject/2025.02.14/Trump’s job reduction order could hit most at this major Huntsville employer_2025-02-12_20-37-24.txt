A new executive order could put thousands of Huntsville jobs -- and potentially billions of contract dollars – at risk.

The White House is championing its efforts to “reduce waste, bloat, and insularity” – at a time when salaries account for less than 5 cents on the dollar of federal spending.

The executive order signed Tuesday by President Donald Trump is the latest action by the new administration to target federal employees. It directs federal agencies to prepare plans for “large-scale reductions in force” – the government’s term for layoffs – as well as ordering a hiring freeze and granting additional power over hiring decisions to the Department of Government Efficiency.
