Captain America: Brave New World has landed in Hollywood, and the social media reactions are arriving as fast as a super soldier running laps around the Washington Monument.

Anthony Mackie stars in Brave New World, which arrives more than a decade after the actor made his Marvel debut in Captain America: The Winter Soldier as Sam Wilson/The Falcon. The new film follows the hero as he dons the mantle of Captain America, following Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) handing him the shield in Avengers: Endgame (2019).

Social media reactions from the premiere and press screenings arrived Tuesday night ahead of formal reviews Wednesday.

Brave New World, first announced in April 2021, has long been awaited. At one point, it was going to open in July 2024, but it became one of many titles pushed back amid the writers and actors strikes.

The film from director Luce filmmaker Julius Onah also stars Harrison Ford as General Ross, the role previously played in the MCU by the late William Hurt. It’s no spoiler to say that Sam Wilson won’t like Ross when he’s angry — as he transforms into the Red Hulk. Mackie officially became Captain America in Disney+ series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, which also introduced Danny Ramirez as his ally Joaquín Torres, who in the movie becomes The Falcon. Liv Tyler, Tim Blake Nelson and Giancarlo Esposito also star.

Brave New World arrived in theaters on Friday. Read on for a sampling of the early reactions.
