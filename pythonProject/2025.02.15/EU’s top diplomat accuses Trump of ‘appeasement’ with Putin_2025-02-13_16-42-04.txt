“Any deal behind our backs will not work,” writes Kaja Kallas as U.S. president imparts “lengthy and highly productive” call with Russian leader.

Kaja Kallas, the European Union's top diplomat, denounced U.S. President Donald Trump’s call with Russian leader Vladimir Putin on Thursday, saying any deal on Ukraine's future that is arranged without European involvement will be a non-starter.

“It is clear that any deal behind our backs will not work. You need the Europeans, you need the Ukrainians,” Kallas told journalists on the sidelines of the NATO defense ministers’ meeting on Thursday.

“Why are we giving them [Russia] everything they want even before the negotiations have started? It's appeasement. It has never worked,” she added.
